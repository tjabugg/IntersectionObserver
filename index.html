    <h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      Cob is proud to present ‘De Anima’, a digital exhibition of work by Nina Mae Fowler and Casper Sejersen,
      and<br />
      of the dialogue from which it emerged.<br />
      <br />
      The title of the exhibition references Artistole’s treatise c. 350 BC that explores the hierarchical structures
      and<br />
      drives of the soul across all living organisms. In the second book of the treatise, Aristotle argues that
      the<br />
      simplest form of perception is an animal ability to feel pleasure and pain – by which, if a human/animal
      can<br />
      feel pleasure and pain they also have desire.<br /> 
      <br />
      Documenting a series of exchanges between Fowler and Sejersen across the vicissitudes of 2020, ‘De Anima’<br />
      forms a dual journal of the pandemic year. In cyberspace, on paper and in cardboard boxes, it traces an<br />
      illuminating and unexpected interchange of positions and dispositions, with each artist reflecting on their
      own<br />
      and the other’s work and feeding the insights back into their practice in an ongoing chain of developing<br />
      interactions.<br />
      <br />
      Though Fowler’s and Sejersen’s practices in drawing and photography are outwardly very different, ‘De
      Anima’<br />
      brings their meditations on motifs including desire, power, pain and performance into close orbit with one<br />
      another. The result is a sustained interrogation of each artist’s approach to the alternating tenderness
      and<br />
      violence of looking and being looked at, and follows Charles Baudelaire’s maxim that the best criticism of
      a<br />
      work of art is another work of art.<br />
      <br />
      One thing that becomes clear throughout the exchange is the way that Fowler and Sejersen each revel in<br />
      material finesse. Meticulous approaches to craft and scrupulous attention to detail emerge as common
      strands<br />
      through which their mutual confrontation with counterpoints like desire and repulsion, passion and<br />
      intellection, control and chaos are shaped and channelled. An antidote to the profusion of cheap imagery in
      our<br />
      internet age, their work nevertheless takes this imagery seriously as the building blocks of our common
      dream<br />
      -world – and it is out of this clash that the vitality of the work shines through. In this respect, it is apt
      that
      the<br />
      exhibition recalls the Surrealists’ game of the ‘exquisite corpse’ not only in its formal structure, but also in
      its<br />
      vision of reality as underscored by submerged energies, of the waking world as saturated by dream.<br />
      <br />
      The rolling metamorphosis of ideas to which ‘De Anima’ bears witness, a process of accretion and
      evolution,<br />
      echo and exchange, offers a singular example of the pent-up energies of lockdown being redirected to<br />
      productive ends.The intensities of contemplation and confrontation with the self, the sense of profound<br />
      distance from those close to us and the countervailing immediacy of the far away – all of these phenomena
      are<br />
      crystallised by Sejersen and Fowler into something unusual and enriching, forming a lasting account of an<br />
      experience which has shaped us all.<br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Dear Casper,<br />
        <br />
        Here is my first drawing in response to the box of objects you sent me.<br />
        <br />
        I saw a noose like wire, a broken flash bulb, a woman restrained, an abandoned key and these things combined led
        me to make this drawing.<br />
        <br />
        The drawing is based on Pier Angeli who committed suicide (age 39) from an overdose of barbituates, having
        failed 4 previous suicide<br />
        attempts. At 22 she was deeply in love with James Dean but her mother + MGM Studios forbade the relationship.
        She married someone else,<br />
        and legend has it that Dean stood outside the church and revved his motorcycle throughout the ceremony.<br />
        <br />
        Just before her suicide she wrote to a friend “I’m so afraid to get old…Love is now behind me, love died in a
        Porsche” (referring to the death of<br />
        James Dean 16 years earlier)<br />
        <br />
        The interior of the drawing is based on the 1948 film “The Snake Pit”. The film recounts the tale of a woman who
        finds herself in an insane<br />
        asylum and cannot remember how she got there.<br />
        <br />
        I hope it provides further inspiration for you!<br />
        <br />
        I look forward to receiving your response to the box.<br />
        <br />

        Dear Nina<br />
        <br />
        Hope you are good and safe… Been looking at Love Died in a Porsche again and again, still can’t believe how you
        can do it… And the James<br />
        Dean and Pier Angeli story, which I did not know about… I mean love!!!<br />
        <br />
        In your box I found … A lipstick container with a secret that made me cry, a magazine with the title “The King
        Is Dead”… I thought of<br />
        parenthood, about raising kids. I thought about the state of the world right now, about love, about youth, about
        revolution, about change… I<br />
        used Elvis, my son, the secret, a lipstick. I used the titles of two Elvis love songs, in a remixed way. Pop
        culture can be so powerful...I made the<br />
        photographs together with my 14 year old son Leo, as his generations wish for the future. As a pacifistic, but
        yet revolutionary way to make<br />
        change… The light on Leos spine in one of the pictures is a tribute to you, the position of Leos head in the
        other picture is a homage to Man<br />
        Ray….<br />
        <br />
        Looking forward to the next step…<br />
        <br />
        LOVE,<br />

        No worries. Here is mine. <br />
        <br />
        It’s a small coloured drawing of ‘Consuela Cosmetic’, a New York drag artist. She appeared posthumously in the
        1996 documentary, <br />
        “Mirror, Mirror” directed by Baillie Walsh. The film depicts the final year of Consuela’s life. She died of
        complications relating to <br />
        AIDS in March l996, during the film’s post-production. <br />
        <br />
        Your images of Leo and the illusion Man Ray’s photo of Lee Miller - a female neck or a male phallus… also your
        photo of ‘Desmond’<br />
        the 11 yr old ‘Drag Kid’ (which moved me greatly). Gender is such a deeply complicated subject but one which
        fortunately seems to be <br />
        evolving so much lately. Our children have so many more options and choices in which we can support them
        (especially <br />
        at Leo’s crucial age). Like the texts on his body which speak so loudly and unapologetically of the bold choices
        they are set to make. <br />
        Under the cover of pop songs and ballads lies a much stronger significance - I see this same paradox in the
        performances of great drag <br />
        artists.<br />
        <br />
        I am not good with words which is why I make the drawings! Hopefully this one speaks of what I am trying to
        say.<br />
        <br />
        Looking forward to seeing your next one.<br />

        Dear Casper<br />
        <br />
        Here is my response.<br />
        <br />
        I watched a film recently called ‘Secret Ceremony’ with Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Mia Farrow. It
        reminded me of your picture as<br />
        the story is so charged psychologically - it’s about a stepfather who has abused his step daughter for years
        under the nose of the mother. He <br />
        brings her roses and continues to abuse her sexually and mentally until eventually she commits suicide. In this,
        the last scene (having murdered<br />
        the stepfather beside her daughters open casket) Elizabeth Taylor recounts a fable about two mice:<br />
        <br />
        “Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned, but the second mouse,
        he struggled so hard that he<br />
        eventually churned the cream into butter and he walked out.”<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Hence the title of the drawing.<br />
